# Validation and CI

## Lane model

`lotus-workbench` uses:

1. `Remote Feature Lane`
2. `Pull Request Merge Gate`
3. `Main Releasability Gate`

## Local command mapping

- `make check`
  lint, typecheck, coverage-backed test gate, build
- `make test-e2e`
  Playwright smoke validation
- `make ci-local-docker`
  Docker parity
- `npm run live:validate`
  canonical integrated product validation

## What the gates protect

- real app-surface coverage across the active product paths
- browser smoke for supported front-office flows
- Docker parity for production-like runtime assumptions
- canonical seeded-data validation for integrated product proof
